# TevRig
this is just an archive and I do not give a shit what you do with this as long as you dont sell it  
and if you do changes please credit me as the original auther of tevrig, but you can do what ever you want now  
  
The reason why I didnt continue working on this is because I do not enjoy making rigs anymore at all
its just pure boring work that you need to do, tbh I dont even know how I enjoyed it but its just pure labor for something that dont many people use
Also, I do NOT guarantee this to work with UEFN, UE or any other platform, this was purely made for blender and was never meant to work outside so don't bother me with that 

So do wonders and change modify spread the rig and spread the word!
